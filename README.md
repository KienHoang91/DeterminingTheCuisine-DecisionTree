# DeterminingTheCuisine-DecisionTree
Determine the cuisine of the dish associated with the list of ingredients
## Data: 
Food recipes (cuisines and ingredients) from three different websites have already acquired the data and placed it on an IBM server:
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/recipes.csv
* www.allrecipes.com
* www.epicurious.com
* www.menupan.com
### Creating a decision tree for the recipes for just some of the Asian (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai), Indian and French, Canadian, Vietnamese cuisines. The reason for this is because the decision tree does not run well when the data is biased towards one cuisine, in this case American cuisines. One option is to exclude the American cuisines from our analysis or just build decision trees for different subsets of the data.
